[minitorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch) is a DIY project that implements the core internal concepts underpinning deep learning systems from scratch in native Python. Shout out and thank you to Sasha Rush [(@srush_nlp)](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp) and all contributors of minitorch for creating great open-source learning resources like this one.

## Training classifiers 
Classifiers can be trained using the notebooks in `/notebooks` or through a Streamlit app (see below). The repository defines four example training datasets for training the classifiers. Examples outputs of the training process for each dataset can be found below.
